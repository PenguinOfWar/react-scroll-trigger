# React Scroll Trigger

React component that monitors `scroll` events to trigger callbacks when it enters,
exits and progresses through the viewport. All callback include the `progress` and
`velocity` of the scrolling, in the event you want to manipulate stuff based on
those values.

## Install

Via [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-trigger)
```
npm install react-scroll-trigger
```

Via [Yarn](http://yarn.fyi/react-scroll-trigger)
```
yarn add react-scroll-trigger
```

### Requirements

* [react](https://npmjs.com/package/react)
* [react-dom](https://npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
* [prop-types](https://npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
* [lodash](https://npmjs.com/package/lodash)

## How to use

```
import ScrollTrigger from 'react-scroll-trigger';

...

  onEnterViewport() {
    this.setState({
      visible: true,
    });
  }

  onExitViewport() {
    this.setState({
      visible: false,
    });
  }

  render() {
    const {
      visible,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <ScrollTrigger onEnter={this.onEnterViewport} onExit={this.onExitViewport}>
        <div className={`container ${visible ? 'container-animate' : ''}`}
      </ScrollTrigger>
    );
  }
```

The `ScrollTrigger` is intended to be used as a composable element, allowing you
to either use it standalone within a page (ie. no children).

```
  <ScrollTrigger onEnter={this.onEnterViewport} onExit={this.onExitViewport} />
```

Or, pass in children to receive events and `progress` based on the dimensions of
those elements within the DOM.

```
  <ScrollTrigger onEnter={this.onEnterViewport} onExit={this.onExitViewport}>
    <List>
      [...list items...]
    </List>
  </ScrollTrigger>
```

The beauty of this component is its flexibility. Iâ€™ve used it to trigger
AJAX requests based on either the `onEnter` or `progress` of the component within
the viewport. Or, as a way to control animations or other transitions that you
would like to either trigger when visible in the viewport or based on the exact
`progress` of that element as it transitions through the viewport.

### Properties

Below are the properties that can be defined on a `<ScrollTrigger />` instance.
In addition to these properties, all other standard React properites like `className`,
`key`, etc. can be passed in as well and will be applied to the `<div>` that will
be rendered by the `ScrollTrigger`.

* `triggerOnLoad` - Boolean (Default: `true`)
* `onEnter` - Callback `({progress, velocity}, ref) => {}`
* `onExit` - Callback `({progress, velocity}, ref) => {}`
* `onProgress` - Callback `({progress, velocity}, ref) => {}`
